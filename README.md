  (#overview)
  ​
  Have you ever wanted to play a board game with your family and friends, but spent too much time debating on what game to play due to every players' preference? Do you wish you used that time debating what game to play and spent it playing a game instead? If so, the Board Game Sommelier is for you!
  ​
  First-time users are encouraged to sign up while returning users will log in. From there, users will select what kind of board game mechanics they don't like, and those preferences will be saved to each profile. When a group of saved users are selected, the game mechanics each user doesn't like will be brought together, and from there, a selection of board games will be recommended for a board game night.
